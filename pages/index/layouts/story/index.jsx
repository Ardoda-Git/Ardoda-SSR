                        Our entrepreneurial spirit was forged in the fires of recession. 
                        At our core, we are two brothers who watched our parents build their 
                        enterprises from the ground up following the â€˜08 financial crisis. 
                        <br/><br/>We learned that entrepreneurship and creating value for others is 
                        the only way to contribute towards change that matters &amp; help 
                        others succeed. In continuing uncertain times, Ardoda will empower 
                        entrepreneurs to create value by providing secure tools for angel 
                        investors.
